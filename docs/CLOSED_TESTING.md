### Overview

To publish Fidely on the Google Play Store, the app must successfully complete the **mandatory closed testing period** required by Google. This is a critical step in the app release process that ensures the application meets Google's quality standards before being made available to the general public.

### Current Status

Testing has already begun, but **Google has determined that the current testing is not sufficient** to proceed with the public release. I need to expand the testing program to meet Google's requirements.

### What is Closed Testing?

Closed testing is a pre-launch testing phase where a limited group of users tests the application in a real-world environment. This helps identify and fix bugs, performance issues, and usability problems before the app reaches a wider audience.

### Why I Need Your Help

I am actively seeking participants to join the closed testing program. Your participation is essential to:

- **Identify bugs and issues** that may not have been discovered during internal testing
- **Evaluate app performance** across different devices and Android versions
- **Gather feedback** on user experience and functionality
- **Meet Google's requirements** for the number of testers and testing duration
- **Ensure a quality experience** for all users when the app launches publicly

### Benefits for Testers

As a tester, you will:

- **Get early access** to Fidely before its public release
- **Directly influence** the app's development with your feedback
- **Help shape** the final product that will be released on Google Play
- **Be recognized** in the app credits as an official tester
- **Contribute** to the success of this project

### Requirements from Google

Google Play requires:

- A minimum number of 12 active testers
