# Privacy Policy – Fidely

**Last updated:** January 2, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Fidely is an application designed to operate **entirely offline**. Protecting user privacy is a core principle: the app does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

By using Fidely, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Data Collection
Fidely **does not collect any personal data**, including but not limited to:
- Name, email address, or contact details
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage data or analytics

All data entered by the user remains **exclusively on the user’s device**.

## 3. Data Storage
- All data is stored locally on the user’s device
- No data is uploaded to external servers or cloud services
- The developer has no access to user data

## 4. Data Sharing
Fidely **does not share data with third parties**, as it does not access or transmit any information.

## 5. App Permissions
Fidely may request the following **optional permissions**:

- **Camera access**, used exclusively for scanning barcodes
- **Photo library access**, used exclusively to scan barcodes from existing images

These permissions are **not mandatory**. The app remains fully usable without granting them, except for barcode scanning features.

No images, scans, or related data are stored outside the device or transmitted elsewhere.

## 6. Open-Source Code
Fidely is released as **open-source software**.  
The full source code is publicly available and can be inspected at any time:

https://github.com/riccardo-tralli/fidely-app

This allows independent verification that no data collection, tracking, or transmission occurs.

## 7. Security
Data security depends on the protection level of the user’s device. Users are encouraged to enable device-level security such as PINs, passwords, or biometric authentication.

## 8. Children
Fidely does not collect data and may be used by children under the responsibility of a parent or legal guardian.

## 9. Changes to this Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be communicated through the app or its distribution platforms.
